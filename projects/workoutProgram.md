Luckily, I was allowed to help my friend start his fitness journey. He came to me asking for a simple program that would allow him to work out at home with his current equipment. Based on my experience working out rigorously at that time and my experience as a tennis assistant coach, I believed I could help him start his fitness journey. I usually create my own programs, programs that are tailored to what I enjoy and believe will help me achieve my goals, having to create a program for another individual challenged my fundamentals of creating programs
