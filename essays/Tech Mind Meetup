## Thoughts about TypeScript

I never heard of TypeScript till I took this course and to be honest it proves to be challenging. Getting the concepts down is one thing but the other is figuring out what to type. What I mean by this is the syntax. My thoughts on TypeScript are not positive as the syntax makes it hard to enjoy. It is a superset of JavaScript but when comparing learning curves, TypeScript appears to be a lot steeper in my case. It might be due to the fact I have never dealt with this programming language and we dove straight into it. Though I believe in the next few weeks I will be a lot more confident with the language. I find myself having to look up help for syntaxes while working rather than taking my own time outside of class hours to read up on the language. So, I can't blame TypeScript for anything or give it a rating due to my lack of experience.

## The WODs or Whats?

The WODs are super helpful. The past ICS courses I have taken never had such a practice and I wish they did. It has helped me get in touch with the concepts of coding. Most of the time the ICS classes you only get a feel of the concepts and syntax through homework which in most cases is only once a week. These WODs keep me in check and I enjoy that feeling. It is a bit stressful but I believe this feeling is only due to how new of a practice it is for me. My typical week only included 1-2 days of programming due to a coding assignment and I felt like an un-athletic programmer. Now that these WODs are in place I feel a lot more capable and I believe it works out well for me. What I do think might cause issues for others if they are taking a lot of other courses. The amount of credits I am taking this semester seems like the appropriate amount to take this course which is 15 and I think any more can cause issues in terms of balancing time.
