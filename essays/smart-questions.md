## Why Asking the Right Question is Crucial

It is a key component in being able to formulate your thoughts into words that can be understood by others. Having this key helps you stand out in your environment as you are easy to communicate with. Being a student makes this key component a necessary tool to have. Most of the time you will be communicating through questions. If your questions aren't formulated in the way they should be, you are most likely to run into the wrong answers. This concept can be not only applied in the classroom but even in your studies or work. Be patient and mindful of what exactly it is you want and formulate it in a way that is understandable and answerable. Such a practice will prevent a waste of time or more confusion.

## Whatâ€™s a smart question?

A smart question describes a goal. When your goal has been given, you can then expand upon the steps you have taken to the point you have been blocked. This gives readers or helpers that you are reaching out to, maybe on a platform like StackOverflow, a summary of your issue and what guidance is needed. Having a detailed and precise explanation is critical, without the proper context you are most likely to receive zero answers. You may be thinking of open-ended questions to be a possible question choice but questions like these are rather difficult to answer. This means the best answers will come from more experienced individuals, who are most likely going to be too busy to give an immediate reply or a reply at all.

Here is an example of a smart question, "How do I delete a Git branch locally and remotely?". This user then provided his failed attempts:

```
$ git branch -d remotes/origin/bugfix
error: branch 'remotes/origin/bugfix' not found.

$ git branch -d origin/bugfix
error: branch 'origin/bugfix' not found.

$ git branch -rd origin/bugfix
Deleted remote branch origin/bugfix (was 2a14ef7).

$ git push
Everything up-to-date

$ git pull
From github.com:gituser/gitproject

* [new branch] bugfix -> origin/bugfix
Already up-to-date.
```
Here is his question attached below his issue, "How do I properly delete the remotes/origin/bugfix branch both locally and remotely?". Notice his header is brief and he provides the problem he is running into. This caused the post to receive +20367 votes and to be viewed 12.4m times. These types of questions spark up the answers and debates. Making it a huge success of a question, as he is most likely to receive the answer he wants and many more other possible answers. Being straightforward and clear comes a long way but is very rewarding. Now compare this question to the not-so-smart question.

An example of a not-so-smart question I found on Stack Overflow is, "How can I answer a question when I can't find any "answer" button? And why can it ever happen?". This question received -25 votes. Not too many people found this question relevant or very important. What I am implying here is the question this user inputted was not formulated. This means the user posted this question without looking into the problem himself, resulting in the post being closed and receiving -25 votes and only 204 views. As his problem was really simple another responded stating that it was a blog post, hence there was no answer button and a reason for not being able to see an answer button on question posts is due to the question post being marked closed. What can be observed is the initial poster did not use his own time to dig into the issue and did not familiarize himself with the Stack Overflow program.

## Key Takeaways

Be patient with yourself before blurting out questions. Take the time to figure out if you are stuck and need help. If you do end up stuck remember to formulate the question in a digestible manner, provide a brief and descriptive context to your issue, and if possible show the code snippet or issue you are facing. Many individuals rush their questions because they want the answer right away, leading them to create confusing questions and receive no replies. Taking time and focus reveals the answer faster than most would think.
