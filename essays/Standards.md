*Difficulty: an idea or thing used as a measure, norm, or model in comparative evaluations.*

Understanding the key basics or fundamentals in any practice is an important factor. Having such knowledge allows individuals the ability to branch out in the practice they wish to grow in with little to no issues. Algebra for example in Calculus, it's the most basic necessity required. Having a lack of experience with Algebra can cause a lot of issues when trying to understand Calculus.

## Standards in Programming

It was difficult starting with ESLint. Most of the projects that I have done so far only required VSCode and the extensions required for certain assignments. Having to download ESLint and install it taught me invaluable lessons about how important directories are or where you place your files. Powershell was used to check for the installation of ESLint and if your directory led to the wrong path you could not run or use ESLint. It certainly was frustrating as I had to double-check I had ESLint on the right path and had the right version running. In one instance my powershell would be able to read the location of the installed ESLint but my VSCode failed to. It was frustrating but I realize that getting this down would set me up later in my programming journey. The other big learning experience was using GitHub Desktop. I learned how to clone a repository, edit the repo, commit the edits, and push to the origin.

One of the biggest issues was using the Prettier extension. There was a big issue when dealing with double quotes in one of our assignments. There was an issue with the double quotes used in one of the Typescript files, a simple fix was to change the double quotes to single quotes, however, this was not the case. Every time I tried to save the code or click out of the workspace the single quotes would revert to double quotes. Initially, I thought I had made an issue following the steps to set up the repo and its files but it was the extension's fault. It had to deal with a format issue and all I had to do was set the property to false.

Reflecting on all that we had done so far with ESLint, VSCode, and GitHub it was a humbling experience but a very valuable one. There are new things to learn every day and getting caught up in the frustration of failure can prevent progress. Having this in mind now when I overcome new material I believe I will do a lot better job.
