Luckily, I was allowed to help my friend start his fitness journey. He came to me asking for a simple program that would allow him to work out at home with his current equipment. Based on my experience working out at that time and my experience as a tennis assistant coach, I believed I could help him start his fitness journey. I usually create my own programs, programs that are tailored to what I enjoy and believe will help me achieve my goals but having to create a program for another individual challenged my fundamentals of creating programs.

One of the main problems this project had was my resources were limited to what he had at home. I was so used to having all the possible equipment you could want in a gym but I had to start from square one. He had a set of adjustable dumbells, a bench, and a curl bar. Another issue was that I enjoy compound movements for workouts such as the squat, bench, and deadlift, which all require a bar in most cases. However, given proper information and my understanding of possible workouts to substitute for the missing components the program was executable. After a series of meetings with my friend and a couple of videos we were able to come to a final product.

This project taught me a lot in terms of working with a customer. Though I was already friends with the individual, it gave me the idea that befriending or having a nice relationship with the individual you are providing service to creates a solid foundation and smooth operation. There were times when he wouldn't agree with certain workouts and I had to learn to either persuade him or find another option. Most of the time it was the leg portion of the program he found displeasing but I managed to convince him it was the best part of the program. In conclusion, I learned customer relationships and being flexible are key components to a healthy workflow.
