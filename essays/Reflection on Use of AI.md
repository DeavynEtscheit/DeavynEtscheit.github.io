## My General Thoughts on AI

AI can serve in two ways, as a mentor or as your butler. Why I state this is you can learn from the use of AI and also fail to learn. This means the way you use AI determines its impact on your education, it can have a positive effect or a negative effect. 
I have fallen victim to both effects throughout this semester. It has served me both as a mentor and a butler. There have been cases where I had only used AI to help explain content material and in other cases, I have used it to do my work for me, which made it more difficult. The mentor part is self-explanatory but the butler portion needs more explaining. Using AI in this course has shown me that it is not always right and can lead to more messes. Being clueless and depending on AI can get you into trouble. Having AI generate code for you is risky as you would only be copy-pasting and looking at the output and not paying attention to the code itself, this is where I have made multiple mistakes. I have used ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini in this course.

## How I used AI

I used AI throughout the entire course and my uses varied depending on the given assignment. For WODs, the in-class WODs that were timed and graded, I was reliant on AI to generate my code and I spent a lot of time working on debugging and adjusting the code to what I needed it to do. For example, the Island Snow WODS was difficult for me as I spent a good portion of my time trying to get the navbar displayed how I wanted it to. For in-class practice WODs, I relied on my peers rather than AI, dependent on group thoughts instead. Essays have all been written by me, and have not used it to come up with some ideas, to me it seems pointless as this isn't a WI course even though we write a lot of essays. For the Final Project, I was highly dependent on the use of AI, as I ran into many errors and was very confused about syntax and commands to use in my terminal, such as npm ci, which uninstalls all packages and reinstalls them all at the same time so everything is working smoothly. I have used AI in looking up answers to questions asked in class, in-fact we were encouraged to do so. To ask or answer smart questions in Discord I didn't see the need for AI, as I would be explaining to AI what my issue is and asking it to make a question to ask everyone in the Discord server. I have used AI in explaining numerous times, I have used it when learning Bootstrap, react, and Typescript as the syntax was new or odd to me to understand. I have also used AI to document code whether it be code that I wrote, code that I wrote, or code given to me, I did this to save time, and was helpful when I prompted it to give me an explanation for each line of code. Running lint was painful as you would get numerous lines that needed fixing, and I have used it to help me fix the issues. For example, one time there was this line of code that exceeded 120 characters and needed a new line, at first I thought it was as simple as breaking it apart anywhere but it was not. There are specific areas in a line of code that are ok to input breaks for a new line and I had AI teach me which areas. I have only used AI in the fields I deemed necessary.


## How AI has Affected My Learning and Understanding

AI has had a huge impact on my ability to write code for myself. I have spent more time debugging the code given to me by AI than actually writing code, which is mostly due to the final project. My use of AI in the final project was immense and given the time we had to get the project done, I believe I would have struggled a lot to get it done in time. Although I feel like using AI early has given me insight into the many negatives it brings with its positives. It can help and also slow the learning of an individual as that person may become too dependent on AI. Having self-control is key when using AI as it is a powerful tool and with great power comes great responsibility.

## AI in the Future of Education

AI can benefit education in the future, especially in the field of software engineering. Implementing an AI that can track the student's use of AI is something I have always thought about, it could help teachers better understand which students are tackling their assignments and who using AI to do it for them. As mentioned before AI can bring both positives and negatives, its use and implementation in education must be taken with extreme care to ensure the intended outcome is what is harvested in the end.

## Conclusion

AI has been a butler and mentor to me throughout this course. There were times I highly depended on it and times when I barely used it. AI will benefit those who know how to use it and when to use it, those who abuse it will never understand concepts to the very root of their core nor tackle problems on the spot. I have learned that it is a magnificent tool to have but can also be a painful one.
