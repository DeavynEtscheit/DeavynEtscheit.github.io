summary: "I created a GitHub repository for a club called ICSpark at UH Manoa called SimpleCalculator. It was a lesson created to help the middle-high school students get familiar with methods and their basic concepts in JavaScript."

This project aimed to help teach middle-high school students about declaring and calling functions and adding parameters for those functions to take on. To accomplish this, I communicated with club leaders about possible lesson ideas and a simple calculator project was the conclusion. I needed to make the lesson digestible and challenging at the same time. To do this I made sure not to include the entire code solutions but rather point out what was missing. This ensured that the students had to recall from previous lessons and engage with the lesson instead of simply copying and pasting code. 

I was in charge of creating the repository and the entire lesson. The task was a huge responsibility and challenged me greatly on what I have learned in my first 2 years as a Computer Science major. I was not only doing this project for myself but for other students that I was mentoring. I had to communicate with fellow clubmates and club leaders to ensure the lesson plan made sense from an outside perspective. 

What I learned from this project was how to navigate and use GitHub, how to communicate in a team environment, and ask for help. The last two I believe are very important tools that I will in my career. I believed I could do the work alone but this project showed me that working in a team gives huge benefits. They gave insight into my lesson description and the flow of the lesson whether it was too fast or slow-paced. My biggest takeaway from this project was realizing the value that a team provides and how much fun it is to be a part of one.
