## Estimations

I used previous classwork and WODs to help in my estimations. WODs were typically 45 minutes at the longest and we are moving as fast as we can to not get a DNF(Did Not Finish) time. Judging from the time it took me to complete certain tasks such as setting up the navbar or simple ui stuff I would give myself an hour. Although the final project has proved to me that even problems that you have run into before can still give you a hard time, proving to be a very humbling and tiring experience. There were times I was generous and set two hours for myself but ended up overshooting the time, this is mostly on effort aside from coding, such as syntax explanations and research. 

## Tracked Work

Tracking my work has proven to be a useful practice. It showed me if coding was taking up more of my time or not, proving to me if I  knew the language or framework. Tracking my effort has shown that not all estimations are true as they are estimations, meaning you can either overshoot them or undershoot them. For Milestone 1(M1), I finished a lot earlier than expected but for M3 I overshot my estimations by a lot. I used Waka time and a regular timer to track my time. The Waka timer was used to track how long I coded and the regular timer was to check my overall time working on the issue. Subtracting the Waka time and regular timer would give me the time I spent on other parts of the issue that weren't coding. I believe this method gave me the best time data for my time and I overshot my time estimations more than I undershot them.
