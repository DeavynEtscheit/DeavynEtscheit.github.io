## Thoughts about Bootstrap

I was familiar with HTML and CSS and did know about UI Frameworks, but having to use them all on projects made it a bit frustrating. I have only used HTML and CSS outside of class in club activities. The depth we had to go into HTML and CSS was simple compared to what we did in this class. It was simply a frustrating and humbling experience. I had to relearn HTML and CSS and factor in a framework I never heard of. Our tasks and assignments in class were to clone or make copies of websites without their functionalities, such as working links or buttons. So, it was easier as factoring in those attributes would have been more frustrating and a lot more difficult. Making certain paragraphs line up with each other, or texts line up in rows rather than stacking up on each other, were my biggest weaknesses. Formatting overall was my biggest weakness when it came to these assignments. I could get all the images and colors to show up properly, but getting them to the format that was needed was frustrating. I greatly underestimated the depth of knowledge and skill required to create the UI of websites and I am glad that we were given a glimpse of it. In the image above, you can see my copy of the Zenimax media page. The original can be viewed [here](https://www.zenimax.com/en). The main difference is the background doesn't change every time you visit the page. When I originally viewed the website, the background image was the image you see in my copy. My copy is identical but there are differences you can spot out with closer observation. The layout is simple, but it was a humbling experience trying to copy the website perfectly. 

## Changing My Framework

When failing a task or coming short of deadlines, it's obvious there was an issue that prevented a successful finish. In my case, I underestimated how complicated HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap can become. I gave little attention to the details and failed to put effort into the opportunities to practice their use. Now with the knowledge and having experienced using HTML, CSS, and a UI framework, I will give more time and effort so that I may not make the same mistakes again. I now have a lot of respect for those who work on the UI for websites. They had to come up with the design and implement them, which is very impressive and I would like to one day converse with an expert in this type of work.
