## My Thoughts

This course has taught me some of the most important fundamental skills in software engineering. It has been a fun and engaging course, challenging my prior knowledge of software engineering and broadening it as well. Some of the concepts I was new to covered in this course along with the skills I have acquired will be covered in this essay. Such concepts are open-source software development, development environments, coding standards, ethics in software engineering, and user interface frameworks. This course has given me the chance to understand these core concepts and I would like to share my understanding of them and how might I use them later in my career.

## Open Source Software Development and Configuration Management

What enabled me to understand open-source software development was the use of GitHub. This concept is a collaborative model where the project is open for anyone to view and contribute to the project. The final project required Github and it opened a lot of experiences and practice. I was able to communicate with my groupmates in creating issues and branches and making sure merges never ended up conflicting with other branches. We had a minor issue regarding the UI where the navbar failed to display certain tabs that were previously there. Learning to review and create pull requests was something I was very new to, this class gave me a lot of opportunities to practice this skill and I am a lot more confident in doing this. What ties in with an open-source project is configuration management. Having different branches allowed us to work on the project with different features and at most times having to ensure these features didn't alter other features from other branches required constant communication. It made me realize that software engineering requires a lot of communication skills and uptime in response, as some other developers will be dependent on your branch to be merged for them to do their work. 

## Coding Standards and Ethics in Software Engineering

Coding standards and ethics in software engineering to me are connected. Coding standards are rules that developers must do their best to abide by when writing code, in other words, it's a set of responsibilities just like ethics. Developers who write and format their code are ethical developers at the same time, as they are taking on their tasks with proper care. Such a practice ensures that every other developer part of the same project can understand the code. Writing code for your understanding and little care for documentation neglects collaboration with other developers, making you an unethical software engineer. In any field of computer science collaboration is key, I have learned it from this course, and not following the standards and having ethics will make you an unsuccessful software engineer.

## What My Future Goals Are

I want to be a software engineer who can work with other software engineers in a happy and productive environment. I want to be able to create such an environment and contribute to it as well. I have learned that having an environment filled with individuals with great communication skills, respect for ethics, and adherence to coding standards ensures work gets done productively and enjoyably. It is impossible to be liked by everyone and I know that there will be issues I will run into but with the lessons and skills I have obtained from this course I am sure I will take them on with confidence.
